# ManageMe (trademarked xD)
_signed: **Luka Gro≈°elj**_

**ENG**
- User interface, that makes the job of a team-leader/manager/shift-leader/project-manager a lot easier.
- More specifically the idea behind is a schedule manager for a team under someone's leadership, the program would be designed to calculate the best possible schedule for the week so that everybody works or gets what they feel like they need.

_I would love to explain the whole project but it's too risky, so if you think you have an idea or something that might help me or maybe even considering joining in on the project yourself do contact me._

**PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT**
_As the only developer on this project I wish to make it as usable as possible. Nearly flawless. Damn near perfect._
  Want to make it big. Centralise everything, have an IT-support team on issues that might occur, a small developing team that is ready to work together and make this thing huge!
  
  **_I want this to be the only managing software anybody will ever talk about!_**
